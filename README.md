# Tetris with CreateJS

This is a Tetris clone for the web, using JavaScript as its' backbone and the
HTML canvas as its render surface.  To aid in the manipulation of the canvas
and audio system, CreateJS and their corresponding libraries were used.

It's still very basic, and needs some polishing, but it does the job.

This was created as a better look into the CreateJS suite.

#### My personal thoughts and opinions:

All together, it took about 4 days to complete.  This includes time spent on:
doing other shit, staring at the wall, reading, playing on the internet like a
retard, etc.  This means that this project is definitely something doable in a
business work week for one person.

Anyway, the idea of writing more graphically complex games in EaselJS was ruled
out based on my work through this project, but was also rejected by my friend
who is also skilled in web and game development.

Tetris is a very simple game graphically, and as such I didn't need anything
overly complicated.  He however began with a more complex game, and very quickly
realized all of the functionality he needed to make it look, feel, and flow like
it should... well... EaselJS just didn't have it where it counted.

I guess the analogy is something like this: EaselJS provides you with all the
norms.  Power locks, power windows, etc.  It's a normal car.  Nothing truly
special, nothing really terrible, and it gets you from A to B while providing
you with working A/C.  It's not a muscle car though and if you want to go fast,
you have to get a muscle car.

That said, I was fairly happy with SoundJS and PreloadJS.  I didn't make
extensive use of the libraries, but for what I wanted to do it was relatively
easy to make it do it.  I wasn't fond of Preload's naming conventions but I was
pleased with the core design.
